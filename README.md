I developed this program for one of my friends university project. This program can perform the following:

1. User authentication to login into the ATM system (assuming that the user already has a bank account with user id  and password stored in a file called idpassword.txt)

2. Display a MENU with the following SIX (6) options that allow the account user to choose:
  1. Balance Inquiry
  2. Withdrawal
  3. Deposit
  4. Account Statement
  5. Password Update
  6. Exit
  
  
This system will be able to track the amount initially stored in the bank account.
It can also track every subsequent transaction the bank account user performs.
